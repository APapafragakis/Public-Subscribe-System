# Public-Subscribe-System

This project implements a Public Subscribe System as part of the CS-240 course project in 2 Phases,
one with lists and the other with trees. 
The system is designed to handle events such as information insertion, subscriber registration, consumption, subscriber deletion, and printing of system data structures.
